Hello,
I created this market store system in Java in NetBeans IDE 8.2
To start application you need NetBeans for Java and you need to import my project.When you do that and open project there should be one package firstPackage and in that package should be classes Card, BronzeCard, SilverCard, GoldCard, Client, PayDesk and Main class.
Source files are in src\firstPackage.
Application is supposed to be started from Main class. 
Class Card is abstract class and classes BronzeCard, SilverCard, GoldCard are derived from it. Class Card has attributes that define discount card and has function to set and get that attributes , function that calculate discount rate and abstarct function toString that will return some String and that string will be printed in output.
Classes derived from are very similar , only differences between them is how discount rate is calculated and what String will be returned for printing. 
Class Client represents customer who made purchase. Client has String clientName and Card discountCard as attributes.When constructor is called it puts his name and ask you to enter what type of card customer has. If you enter 1 then customer has bronze card , if you enter 2 then customer has silver card and if you enter 3 then customer has gold card. If you do not enter valid number it will ask you to enter number again. When you select valid number (1,2 or 3) instance of class BronzeCard,SilverCard or GoldCard (depends on selected number) is created as discountCard, discountCard is type of Card but this is possible because classes BronzeCard,SilverCard and GoldCard inherited class Card.When constructor of BronzeCard,SilverCard or GoldCard is called , argument String clientName is forwarded further to base class Card. After that you need to enter turnover from previous month and that value is set with function super.setTurnover and then discount rate is calculated with function calculateDisRate and argument is turnover, then that discount rate is set with function super.setDisRate . This is done this way because all attributes are stored in base class Card. After that discountCard is set and instance of class Client is ready for use. 
PayDesk class has no attributes because I don't need them,because it needs to print data. PayDesk has 2 static functions , output has argument Client client and purchase has arguments Client client and double purchaseValue. When function output is called it requires from you to enter value of purchase, then function purchase is called ,arguments purchaseValue and client are forwarded from function output and then function purchase print data of card that customer has then calculates discount and total price of purchase and then print that too.
From Class Main application is started. There are created 3 instances of class Client after every created instance function output is called from class PayDesk, that is possible because function output is static, and instance of class Client is forwarded as argument and that function do it's work as I explained . I created 3 instances because there are 3 types of cards.
